                          The gathered data is processed for the period that is reasonably necessary for the set purpose for which it was initially obtained.

                        <p>
                          GDPR is the EU General Data Protection Regulation that replaces the old Data protection directive 95/46/EC. GDPR came into force 25.05.2018.

                          <b>The GDPR introduces the following obligations for the companies that gather and process personal data:</b>
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Implement measure to ensure the compliance with GDPR.</li>
                            <li>Implement the necessary security measures to protect the rights of the data subjects when gathering and processing data.</li>
                            <li>Conduct data protection impact assessments of high risk processing activities.</li>
                            <li>Implement privacy by default design.</li>
                            <li>Implement the valid data breach notification.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                          Data Controller implements the up to date Privacy Policy and compliance procedures to ensure that the personal data is kept safe and is processed in accordance with the applicable laws.

                          The company employees and other personnel receive the necessary training. All processed data is under review.

                          Implementation of GDPR may require changes to the existing agreements and policies. Should that take place, the clients shall be promptly notified and their consent requested.
